        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1951 - Foundation</strong><br />
          Mallig Plains Colleges (MPC) was founded on February 14, 1951. The
          founder headed by the incumbent president and BOD chairperson of the
          college with other civic-spirited citizens, namely: Mr. Juan A.
          Galapon, Mrs. Felix C. Elefante, Mr. Pedro Y. Lactao, and Rev. Jose
          Pas Franada, responded graciously to the vision of late Mrs. Victoria
          Donato Ignacio, spouse of President Ignacio, to realize her obsession
          to help provide quality education to ambitious children of poor
          immigrants desirous to go beyond elementary school level.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1952 - Expansion</strong><br />
          The school initially opened as a secondary school known as Western
          Isabela Academy (WIA), a non-sectarian proprietary institution, and
          housed in a rented 2-room building along the national highway in
          Casili, Mallig, Isabela. In 1952, the school acquired a new site where
          it is presently located, putting up a school building with more
          classrooms to accommodate the growing school population from
          neighboring towns including some towns of Ifugao and the Mt. Province.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1950s-1990s - Recognition</strong><br />
          The school became popular as a highly performing school in curricular
          and co-curricular activities such as NCEE/NSAT and CAT, gaining
          continuing appreciation and recognition from educational leaders both
          from the public sector, led then by Director Eladio C. Dioko. They
          also observed that the school was comparatively better than many of
          the public vocational agricultural schools in the province, evidenced
          by its functional vegetable gardens and crop farms, along with its
          cattle-raising projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1992-1994 - College Courses</strong><br />
          In 1992–1994, it opened a complete elementary school; and on March 15,
          1994, it acquired a new name, Western Isabela Polytechnic College
          (WIPC), when it offered four (4) degree courses, namely Bachelor in
          Elementary Education (BEEd), Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSEd)
          with Dean Danilo T. Granado as head of the College of Education,
          followed by the appointment of Mr. Rodolfo de Luna as head of BS
          Accountancy, BS Commerce, and the 2-year Computer Secretarial course.
          Mrs. Angela Granado was appointed school registrar while Mrs.
          Juliberta de Luna was named college librarian.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2004 - Renaming</strong><br />
          On January 19, 2004, President Leocadio E. Ignacio, together with the
          BOD members, decided to rename MALLIG PLAINS COLLEGES as a fitting
          tribute to the school's growing service area and clientele,
          particularly the Mallig Plains, which is considered the rice basket of
          Isabela.
